# ATMS 523 SN Weather and Climate Data Analytics
## Project 2: dask & xarray for computing weather and climate diagnostics

Task:
Create code using python `xarray` to organize and reduce climate data.

Task:
Create code using python `xarray` to organize and reduce climate data.  The goal of this analysis will be to detect global atmospheric circulation patterns (or teleconnections) associated with extreme daily precipitation in a certain part of the globe. You will 

(1) Using output from the ERA-5 reanalysis available from the NCAR Research Data Archive, use the precipitation output of ERA-5 to compute a time series of daily precipitation at a given point closest to a city of your choosing.

(2) Determine the 95% values of daily precipitation during a selected particular 3-month period of time associated with the wettest 3 months of the year closest to your city (use the data to tell you this).  Plot a *cumulative distribution function* of all values daily precipitation values during this time and illustrate the 95% value of daily precipitation in millimeters.

(3) Create a map of the composite mean precipitation on days with precipitation meeting the 95% threshold, and the anomaly of precipitation from the 1981-2010 seasonal (i.e., the 3 months you have chosen) mean. This field should be plotted on a cartopy map centered at your city with a 40 x 40 degree lat-lon range.

(4) Using output from the ERA-5 reanalysis available from the NCAR Research Data Archive, compute the global mean fields (use the 12 UTC time for your averages) on days meeting and exceeding the threshold of precipitation calculated in the previous steps of 
- 250 hPa wind speed (contoured) (calculate from u and v wind as a pressure level quantity)
- 850 hPa specific humidity (contoured) (pressure level quantity)
- total atmospheric column water vapor (contoured) (atmospheric integral quantity)
These should be plotted on a `cartopy` map showing a geographic region centered at your city with a 40 x 40 degree lat-lon range.

(5) Compute the anomalies from the 3 month period for the fields identified in (4).

Functionality Requirements:
* The code must use `dask` and `xarray` for the data reduction (without using a for loop to open files), and `matplotlib` to plot the required visualizations.
* You can develop the code using Colab Notebooks, or any other way, but the repository should be submitted to GitHub, and include a descriptive README.md.

Formatting and Documentation Requirements:
* The appropriate references for the data, including DOI numbers, for the datasets used.  
* The code must contain docstrings and comments where appropriate.
* The code must be formatted in PEP8.

GitHub usage requirements:
* The code must be submitted to GitHub Classroom.  

Code submittal:
* Submit a jupyter notebook with your results to Google Classroom by the end of the day Friday, September 16.

Video:
* Submit a summary video of your research process and results to Canvas at the completion of your assignment.  This should be submitted by the end of the day Monday, September 19.
