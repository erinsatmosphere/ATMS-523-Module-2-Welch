# ATMS 523 Weather and Climate Data Analytics
## Project 2: dask & xarray for computing weather and climate diagnostics

Task:
Create code using python `xarray` to organize and reduce climate data.

Task:
Create code using python `xarray` to organize and reduce climate data.  The goal of this analysis will be to detect global atmospheric circulation patterns (or teleconnections) associated with extreme daily precipitation in a certain part of the globe. You will 

(1) Use the precipitation output of ERA-5 to compute a time series of daily precipitation at a given point closest to a city of your choosing. Choose a 3-month period for a given box of 5 x 5 deg lat-lon values over the grid box closest to the city you are examining.  Save this data.

(2) Determine the 95% values of daily precipitation during a selected particular 3-month period for a given box of 5 x 5 deg lat-lon values over the grid box closest to the city you are examining.  Plot a *cumulative distribution function* of all values daily precipitation values and illustrate the 95% value of daily precipitation in millimeters.

(3) Create a map of the composite mean precipitation on 95% days, and the anomaly of precipitation from the 1981-2010 mean. This field should be plotted on a cartopy map centered at your city with a 40 x 40 degree lat-lon range.

Functionality Requirements:
* The code must use `dask` and `xarray` for the data reduction, and `matplotlib` to plot the required visualizations.
* You can develop the code using Colab Notebooks, or any other way, but the repository should be submitted to GitHub as a python script (i.e., .py, not a notebook!), and include a descriptive README.md.

Formatting and Documentation Requirements:
* The appropriate references for the data, including DOI numbers, for the datasets used.  
* The code must contain docstrings and comments where appropriate.
* The code must be formatted in PEP8.

GitHub usage requirements:
* The code must be submitted to GitHub Classroom.  

Code submittal:
* Submit a jupyter notebook with your results to Google Classroom by the end of the day Friday, February 9.

Video:
* Submit a summary video of your research process and results to Canvas at the completion of your assignment.  This should be submitted by the end of the day Monday, February 12.
